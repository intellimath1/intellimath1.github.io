<h2 align = "center"> Welcome to my page!ü§ñüöÄ </h2>

Now that you're here, feel free to check around for what I've been up to lately. Here's my [CV](docs/CV_1.pdf) for starters. 

### Research Interestsüë®‚Äçüî¨üî¨

Coming from a decent controls (EE) background, my interests are at the nexus of _control systems_, _mobile robotics_, and _computer vision_. I firmly believe advances in these fields will push the envelope in robotics and automation as we know it. For my latest research, check out my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=fnsAFv8AAAAJ&hl=en){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} and [ORCID iD](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4239-2941) profiles! I am also open to PhD, research assistantship, or research collaboration opportunities in these areas!

### Projects üë®‚Äçüíª
#### 1. ORB-SLAM2 implementation with a monocular camera
I am currently implementing a popular visual-SLAM framework for stereo, RGB-D, and monocular cameras (ORB-SLAM2) using a basic HD USB cam. Check out the project's [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/intellimath1/ORB-SLAM2-with-monocular-camera) for my progress. The original ROS package for ORB-SLAM2 can be found [here](https://github.com/appliedAI-Initiative/orb_slam_2_ros).

#### 2. Teleoperable and ROS-compliant mini ground vehicle
Using the turtlebot3_teleop package on ROS Melodic, I developed a keyboard-teleoperable ground robot that could also avoid obstacles using a ranging sensor. I wrote the ROS packages for the robot's sensor and actuator from scratch in Python and tested the system on a Raspberry Pi 3 computer. See the [GitHub page](https://github.com/intellimath1/robot_car_ros) for more details. Future releases (with more sensor support) coming soon!

For other projects I've worked on, kindly visit my [GitHub Page](https://github.com/intellimath1).

### Skills

College and research helped me develop and hone skills in `MATLAB`, `Simulink`, `Visio`, `Control Systems Design`, math modelling, and general problem-solving. Now, working as a Robotics Trainee at Robotics & Artificial Intelligence Nigeria (Nigeria's premier robotics and AI research center), I have picked up `Python`, a bit of `C++`, `Git`, basic `OpenCV`, `Robot Operating System (ROS) - Gazebo, RViz`, MIMO-system controller design, system identification, and some CAD (`Fusion 360` and `SolidWorks`). I am also self-studying machine learning and computer vision as they apply to robotics.

### Contact
